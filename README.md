# MovieFevr-react-
MovieFevr made with React
I redid the MovieFevr website but used React this time. This was my first time using react and served as good practice for me.

The main screen leaves you with an empty input field to search for any movie or tv show, this app uses the OMDb API.

After your initial search you can request addition info on the item by clicking the "Read More" button, which will open up a modal with more information.
